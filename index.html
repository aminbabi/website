    The story is about a group of domestic animals who, in an idealistic and revolutionary act,
    <br> flee the owner of the farm (Mr. Jones) from his farm in order to take over the management 
    <br>of the farm and establish "equality" and "welfare" in their community. 
    <br>The movement is led by a group of pigs, but after a while this new group,
    <br> led by a pig named Napoleon, like Mr. Jones, exploits the farm animals and suppresses any opposition.
